    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n    ]\n}\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"

    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n    ]\n}\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"

    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n    ]\n}\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"

A fixme will be added to the point.\nNote that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme\n##### No-delete options\nIn some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed \"because the path is on their private property\").\nHowever, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice \"hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)\nThe correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.\nA no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags."
