Either put in the name of the layer to reuse, or use {builtin: \"layername\", override: ...}\nThe 'override'-object will be copied over the original values of the layer, which allows to change certain aspects of the layer\nFor example: If you would like to use layer nature reserves, but only from a specific operator (eg. Natuurpunt) you would use the following in your theme:\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": \"nature_reserve\",\n \"override\": {\"source\":\n {\"osmTags\": {\n \"+and\":[\"operator=Natuurpunt\"]\n   }\n  }\n }\n}\n```\nIt's also possible to load multiple layers at once, for example, if you would like for both drinking water and benches to start at the zoomlevel at 12, you would use the following:\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": [\"benches\", \"drinking_water\"],\n \"override\": {\"minzoom\": 12}\n}\n```\n</div>"

    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n    ]\n}\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"

    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n    ]\n}\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"

Currently, this is the same as 'false' but this will change in the future\n- or: a hash with options (see below)\n### The delete dialog\n#### Hard deletion if enough experience\nA feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:\n- It is a node\n- No ways or relations use the node\n- The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously\n- The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)\n- The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)\nIn all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.\n#### Soft deletion\nA 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted fromOSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.\nThis makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.\nNote that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme\n##### No-delete options\nIn some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed \"because the path is on their private property\").\nHowever, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice \"hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)\nThe correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.\nA no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags."

A fixme will be added to the point.\nNote that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme\n##### No-delete options\nIn some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed \"because the path is on their private property\").\nHowever, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice \"hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)\nThe correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.\nA no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags."
