     * The dialog is built to be user friendly and to prevent mistakes.
     * If deletion is not possible, the dialog will hide itself and show the reason of non-deletability instead.
     *
     * To configure, the following values are possible:
     *
     * - false: never ever show the delete button
     * - true: show the default delete button

     *

     * #### Hard deletion if enough experience

     * A feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:

     * - It is a node
     * - No ways or relations use the node
     * - The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously
     * - The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)
     * - The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)
     *
     * In all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.
     *
     * #### Soft deletion
     *
     * A 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted fromOSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.
     * This makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.
     *
     * Note that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme
     *
     * ##### No-delete options
     *
     * In some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed "because the path is on their private property").
     * However, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice "hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)
     *
     * The correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.
     * A no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags.
