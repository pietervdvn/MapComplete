     *
     * In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).
     *
     * In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
     * In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
     *
     * To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
     *
     * mappings: [
     *  {
     *      if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     *      then: "Accessible to the general public",
     *      hideInAnswer: true
     *  },
     *  {
     *      if: "access=yes",
     *      then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
     *  },
     *  {
     *      if: "access=no",
     *      then: "Not accessible to the public"
     *  }
     * ]
     *
     *
     * For example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.
     * Then, we would add two mappings:
     * {
     *     if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
     *     then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
     * },
     * {
     *     if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
     *     then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
     *     hideInAnswer: true
     * }
     *
     * Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
     * Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
     *
     * e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
     * For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
     *
     * {
     *     "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
     *     "mappings": [
     *         {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
     *        {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
     *        {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
     *
     *     ]
     * }
     *
     * Also have a look for the meta-tags
     * {
     *     if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
     *     then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
     *     hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"
     * }
