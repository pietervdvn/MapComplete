Either put in the name of the layer to reuse, or use {builtin: \"layername\", override: ...}\n\nThe 'override'-object will be copied over the original values of the layer, which allows to change certain aspects of the layer\n\nFor example: If you would like to use layer nature reserves, but only from a specific operator (eg. Natuurpunt) you would use the following in your theme:\n\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": \"nature_reserve\",\n \"override\": {\"source\":\n {\"osmTags\": {\n \"+and\":[\"operator=Natuurpunt\"]\n   }\n  }\n }\n}\n```\n\nIt's also possible to load multiple layers at once, for example, if you would like for both drinking water and benches to start at the zoomlevel at 12, you would use the following:\n\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": [\"benches\", \"drinking_water\"],\n \"override\": {\"minzoom\": 12}\n}\n```"

If not specified, it'll be appended to the bottom of the featureInfobox.\n\nAt last, one can define a group of renderings where parts of all strings will be replaced by multiple other strings.\nThis is mainly create questions for a 'left' and a 'right' side of the road.\nThese will be grouped and questions will be asked together"

    "description": "In some cases, multiple taggings exist (e.g. a default assumption, or a commonly mapped abbreviation and a fully written variation).\n\nIn the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.\nIn this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\n\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\n\nmappings: [\n {\n     if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\",\n     hideInAnswer: true\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=yes\",\n     then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM\n },\n {\n     if: \"access=no\",\n     then: \"Not accessible to the public\"\n }\n]\n\n\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`.\nThen, we would add two mappings:\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n},\n{\n    if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"\n    hideInAnswer: true\n}\n\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.\nKeep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\n\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.\nFor the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n\n{\n    \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"\n    \"mappings\": [\n        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},\n       {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},\n\n    ]\n}\n\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags\n{\n    if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",\n    hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\"\n}"
