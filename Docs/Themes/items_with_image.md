## All items with images ( [items_with_image](https://mapcomplete.org/items_with_image) )
_This document details some technical information about this MapComplete theme, mostly about the attributes used in the theme. Various links point toward more information about the attributes, e.g. to the OpenStreetMap-wiki, to TagInfo or tools creating statistics_
The theme introduction reads:

> A map showing all items on OSM which have an image. This theme is a very bad fit for MapComplete as someone is not able to directly add a picture. However, this theme is mostly here to include this all into the database, which'll allow this to quickly fetch images nearby for other features

This theme contains the following layers:

 - [item_with_image](../Layers/item_with_image.md)

Available languages:

 - en
 - de
 - es
 - cs
 - hu
 - nl
 - ko

# Layers defined in this theme configuration file
These layers can not be reused in different themes.
