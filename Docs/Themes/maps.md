The theme introduction reads:

> On this map you can find all maps OpenStreetMap knows - typically a big map on an information board showing the area, city or region, e.g. a tourist map on the back of a billboard, a map of a nature reserve, a map of cycling networks in the region, ...) If a map is missing, you can easily map this map on OpenStreetMap.
