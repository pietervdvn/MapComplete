# What do I want to tell at SOTM '22?

4 main topics:

The MapComplete Editor:

- What is MapComplete? The vision
   + Simple to use viewer
   + Simple to contribute
   + Packed with features under the hood (where applicable)
   + Pareto frontier

- What is a theme?
  + One or more layers + introduction text + some meta (such as icon)
  + Vision on what the target group is (who will use it? For what purpose?)
  + Written in a .json-file

- What is a .json-file
  + A flat text-file (create a .txt)

- What is a layer?
  + One logical type of feature
    - Specifiy the tags that are needed to match
    - Uses OSM as default datasource, but an online (sliced) geojson is an option too, e.g. to show/import
  + Specifies the elements to show in the popup
  + Specifies how it is rendered
  + Specifies if new elements can be added and with which tags
  -> Don't mix, e.g. don't mix post-boxes with post offices
  -> Don't use an adverb, e.g. "all shops ~~which accept cash~~". What if the shop is already there but the payment methods are not known yet? (use a filter instead)

- What is a TagRendering?
  + Converts the objects attributes into a text on the screen
  + If a question is added, it'll ask the user the right answer
  -> Do use full sentences
  -> Start with the step 'attributes to text', then add the question
  -> Don't write "yes, this POI has ..." or even worse "yes"/"no"

- Deploying
  + copy paste into a base64-decoder
  + Go to "mapcomplete.org/index?userlayout=true#<paste your encoded file here>"
  + Oh Noes! An error msg!

- sharing
  + Share often and early. I'd rather have a half-finished theme via chat/wiki that can be improved upon then no theme at all
  + When done: make a pull request via github (you'll get translations, documentation, integration with taginfo and a chatbot for free)

- A dash of Magic
  + Calculated tags
  + Twin layers (fritures)
  + Imports

- Future work:
  + Improve this flow
