# Persona: Maarten (professional mapping campaign, imports)

## Background

- Name: Maarten
- Age: 20
- Gender: Male
- Occupation: student of safety prevention
- Computer skills: moderate

## Background

Maarten is studying to become a safety advisor. He is currently doing his internship with a city council.
The city council has an old list lying around where all the defibrillators are located.
It's up to Maarten to cycle through the entire city and to inventorize them all.

## Goals

Making an inventory of all AED's

## Needs and expectations

- Easily add AED's to the map, based on an already existing list
- See which items he's already checked and which he still has to visit
- Add a picture and metadata about every AED

## Scenario

### Preparation

Before starting the survey, the already existing data of the municipality is loaded into a guided import helper - a special theme to support the (re)survey is set up, e.g. with the MapRoulette integration or the 'Notes'-import-flow integration.

Maarten receives a small training on how to use the tools, a few AED's are mapped together.

### Surveying

Maarten cycles around the city, visiting all AEDs that aren't visited yet.
When an AED is mapped, this is done with the import tool and by adding some information.

If a location is visited but the AED doesn't exist anymore, this is marked as such in the import tool

This can take several weeks to complete

### After surveying

After surveying, all the data can be exported using the 'download'-button (which is enabled on the custom theme) for data analysis or to add it to the municipality website.

Alternatively, MapComplete can be embedded in the municipality website directly.
