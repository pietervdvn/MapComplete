# Persona: Pieter (casual OSM contributions)

## Background

- Name: Pieter
- Age: 20-30
- Computer skills: Excellent

## User scenario

Pieter regularly contributes to OpenStreetMap and wants to keep the map up to date.

When a new element appears in the city where he lives - such as a bench or artwork, he'll open up MapComplete to check if that item is already mapped in OpenStreetMap.
If the item is not on OSM, he'll quickly add the item there and fill out the form with all relevant information and adds a picture.

Similarly, when he visits a shop or restaurant, he'll open up MapComplete during the waiting time and check that all the metadata is still correct.

At last, if a feature has been removed in real life or has slightly moved, he'll use MapComplete to udpate this as well.
