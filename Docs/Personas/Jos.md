# Persona: Jos (Crowdsourcing campaign + import)

## Background

Jos works for a national, tourist agency which promotes tourism in the country.
They currently focus on cycle tourism, including ebikes. For this, they'd like to make a map showing all the charging stations for electrical bikes, except that no one knows where these are.

Additionally, other POI (such as toilets, benches and picnic tables) are important as well. For those, various data sets are lying around, all covering different geographical areas and having different formats. He'd love to see those data sets unified and maintained together.

## User scenario

As such, he'd like to facilitate crowdsourcing this data and importing them into OpenStreetMap.

For the POI that are missing - namely the charging stations for electrical bikes - he sets up a custom map with the custom theme generator and starts a media campaign by inviting all partners of the touristical agency to add information about charging stations that they know of. Additionally, a promo video is made to be circulated on social media.

Additionally, a (guided) import is setup for the diverse datasets that are available so that the new points can be integrated as well.
