## Interests & Influences

## Motivations

Tom works for the city council and is responsible for maintaining a lot of data and physical devices.
His days are swamped with big and little tasks to keep everyone in the municipality safe.

## Goals

One of his tasks is to keep an up-to-date list of all the AEDs and to effectively communicate this to his citizens.
Today, a citizen sent an email that they have installed an AED in their shop.

## Needs and expectations

A map showing all nearby AED's, with their availability and if they are publicly accessible.
This map should be easy to maintain if a new AED is placed - 
Even better would be if the person placing the AED is able to fill out all relevant information themself.

Second, if he adds an AED, he'd love that as much apps and maps would show this so that people in need find one.
Ideally, all the AED's would show up in Google Maps as most people are familiar with this.

## Pain points & frustrations

It is hard to maintain a list of all AEDs and to keep this up to date.
The map on the website is oudated and people don't know it exists.
The list on the website is an excel-sheet; in case of an emergency it is nearly impossible to spot which AED is the closest.
