# Persona: Xavier (activist mapping campaign, data activism)

## Background

Name: Xavier
Age: 68
Occupation: Cycling activists
Computer skills: Basic


## Interests & Influences

Xavier is volunteer with the local cycle association.
Together, they want that more people take the bicycle and that cycling becomes safer.

## Motivations

In order to create a safer cycling environment, Xavier wants to urge the local municipality to remove bollards from the cycleways if those bollards don't add value.
But then, they first need to know _where_ all those bollards are - data that the municipality doesn't have as well.

## Scenario

Xavier starts with adding all the bollards in his neighbourhood. He opens up the cycle-infra theme and adds all bollards that he sees while surveying all streets during an afternoon he is out on the streets.

He'll use the data afterwards to inform the municipality where bollards are.
