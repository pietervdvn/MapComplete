# Persona: Mateo (casual user)

## Background

- Name: Mateo


## User scenario

Mateo goes rock climbing every now and then. To discover climbing routes, he uses the climbing map to search for locations.

Before planning a trip, he browses around on the map to see possible climbing crags. He searches climbing crags in the area of interest and zooms then in to see how much climbing routes and of which difficulty they are.

He finds the information he needs, even though he doesn't have an OpenStreetMap account.


After a while, he spots a missing item and signs up to correct this item.
