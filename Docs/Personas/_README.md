# Personas

In this directory, you'll find some possible user profiles and how they interact with MapComplete.

They serve as a baseline, to indicate what type of use cases are important to support for MapComplete.
In other words, these persona's are a part of the vision on what MapComplete should (not) be.
As such, they mostly focus on a specific use case, not necessarily on fluffy background of the persona - unless that background is relevant.

Note that the UserTests might also give a good idea on where usability might go wrong in small, individual steps.
