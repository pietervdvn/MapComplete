# Persona: Elise (communicating about POI)

## Background

- Name: Elise
- Age: 31
- Gender: female
- Occupation: Communication and marketing at a cycling initiative by the city
- Computer skills: Moderate
- Demography: Western, educated, middle class


## Interests & Influences

Elise is a young woman which is worried about climate change and the environment.
As such, she choose to work for an organisation which facilitates cycling in the city, which:

- rents out bicycles to students
- runs a few bicycle repair stores
- install public bicycle pumps all over the city
- maintains the bicycle parkings in the city (e.g. by removing abandoned bicycles)
- and various other actions to reach out

Her job is _communication and social media_, so she has to maintain the website, send out a newsletter and support other campaigns.

## Goals & motivations

For her job, she wants to place a map on her website with all cycle pumps of the city.

However, she doesn't know where all of them are... She has a list of the pumps placed by her employer, but the university has placed quite a few of them as well.
Some other actors (such as shops) have placed a few of them too.

And except for pumps, there are also a few poles where yools (such a screwdrivers, wrenches,... ) are attached for use by the public.

At last, these pumps and tools are broken sometimes, so how to communicate this to the public?

## User scenario

Elise want to have a read-only view with only pumps embedded on her website.

As such, she creates an embed-link on the 'share'-screen where she disables some options to log in (and thus disables making edits), disables all layers she doesn't need and sets a home location.

Furthermore, she makes a second version which only shows bicycle repair shops and embeds this on a different page.
