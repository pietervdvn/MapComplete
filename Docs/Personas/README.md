# Personas / user scenarios

In this directory, you'll find some possible user profiles and how they interact with MapComplete.

They serve as a baseline, to indicate what type of use cases are important to support for MapComplete.
In other words, these persona's are a part of the vision on what MapComplete should (not) be.
As such, they mostly focus on a specific use case, not necessarily on fluffy background of the persona - unless that background is relevant.

Note that the UserTests might also give a good idea on where usability might go wrong in small, individual steps.

## The most important user scenarios are

- [Someone who needs a map with some type of POI (and which in turns becomes a contributor)](./Mateo.md)
- [A casual OSM-contributor](./Pieter.md)
- [Someone who needs to survey a lot of points in the field in a mapping campaign](./Xavier.md)
- [Someone who needs to _re_survey a lot of points](./Maarten.md)
- [Someone who needs to manage data on an ongoing basis (and validate changes)](./Tom.md)
- [Someone who needs to _communicate_ about POI (e.g. on their website)](./Elise.md)
- [Someone who has a dataset and wants it imported into OSM/wants to run a crowdsourced mapping campaign](./Jos.md)
