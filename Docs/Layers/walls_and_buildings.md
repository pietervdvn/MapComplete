# walls_and_buildings

Special builtin layer providing all walls and buildings. This layer is useful in presets for objects which can be placed against walls (e.g. AEDs, postboxes, entrances, addresses, surveillance cameras, â€¦). This layer is invisible by default and not toggleable by the user.

 - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **18** and higher
 - This layer is not visible by default and must be enabled in the filter by the user. 
 - This layer is not visible by default and the visibility cannot be toggled, effectively resulting in a fully hidden layer. This can be useful, e.g. to calculate some metatags. If you want to render this layer (e.g. for debugging), enable it by setting the URL-parameter layer-<id>=true
 - Not visible in the layer selection by default. If you want to make this layer toggable, override `name`
 - Not rendered on the map by default. If you want to rendering this on the map, override `mapRenderings`
 - This layer will automatically load  [entrance](./entrance.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  a calculated tag loads features from this layer (calculatedTag[0] which calculates the value for _entrance_properties)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [advertising](#advertising)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [artwork](#artwork)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [clock](#clock)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [defibrillator](#defibrillator)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [entrance](#entrance)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [ghostsign](#ghostsign)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [postboxes](#postboxes)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [surveillance_camera](#surveillance_camera)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [facadegardens](#facadegardens)
 - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [parking_spaces_disabled](#parking_spaces_disabled)
