 walls_and_buildings 
=====================





Special builtin layer providing all walls and buildings. This layer is useful in presets for objects which can be placed against walls (e.g. AEDs, postboxes, entrances, addresses, surveillance cameras, …). This layer is invisible by default and not toggleable by the user.






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **18** and higher
  - This layer is not visible by default and must be enabled in the filter by the user. 
  - This layer is not visible by default and the visibility cannot be toggled, effectively resulting in a fully hidden layer. This can be useful, e.g. to calculate some metatags. If you want to render this layer (e.g. for debugging), enable it by setting the URL-parameter layer-<id>=true
  - Not visible in the layer selection by default. If you want to make this layer toggable, override `name`
  - Not rendered on the map by default. If you want to rendering this on the map, override `mapRenderings`
  - This layer will automatically load  [entrance](./entrance.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  a calculated tag loads features from this layer (calculatedTag[0] which calculates the value for _entrance_properties)
  - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [clock](#clock)
  - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [defibrillator](#defibrillator)
  - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [entrance](#entrance)
  - This layer is needed as dependency for layer [surveillance_camera](#surveillance_camera)

### entrance_info 



This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only





  - *No entrance has been marked*  corresponds with  `_entrances_count=0`
  - *None of the {_entrance_count} entrances have width information yet*  corresponds with  `_entrances_count_without_width=_entrances_count`




### biggest_width 



This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only
