### images 



This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only





### kerb-type 



The question is  *What is the height of this kerb?*





  - *This kerb is raised (>3 cm)*  corresponds with  `kerb=raised`
  - *This kerb is lowered (~3 cm)*  corresponds with  `kerb=lowered`
  - *This kerb is flush (~0cm)*  corresponds with  `kerb=flush`
  - *There is no kerb here*  corresponds with  `kerb=no`
  - This option cannot be chosen as answer
  - *There is a kerb of unknown height*  corresponds with  `kerb=yes`
  - This option cannot be chosen as answer


This tagrendering is only visible in the popup if the following condition is met: `_geometry:type=Point`



### tactile-paving 



The question is  *Is there tactile paving at this kerb?*





  - *This kerb has tactile paving.*  corresponds with  `tactile_paving=yes`
  - *This kerb does not have tactile paving.*  corresponds with  `tactile_paving=no`
  - *This kerb has tactile paving, but it is incorrect.*  corresponds with  `tactile_paving=incorrect`
  - This option cannot be chosen as answer


This tagrendering is only visible in the popup if the following condition is met: `_geometry:type=Point`



### kerb-height 



The question is  *What is the height of this kerb?*

This rendering asks information about the property  [kerb:height](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:kerb:height) 

This is rendered with  `Kerb height: {kerb:height}`





  - *This kerb is flush and is lower than 1cm.*  corresponds with  `kerb:height=0`
