MapComplete has a few data layers available in the theme which have special properties through builtin-hooks. Furthermore, there are some normal layers (which are built from normal Theme-config files) but are so general that they get a mention here.

 selected_element 
==================



<img src='https://mapcomplete.org/circle:red' height="100px"> 

Highlights the currently selected element. Override this layer to have different colors






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **0** and higher
  - **This layer is included automatically in every theme. This layer might contain no points**
  - Elements don't have a title set and cannot be toggled nor will they show up in the dashboard. If you import this layer in your theme, override `title` to make this toggleable.
  - Not visible in the layer selection by default. If you want to make this layer toggable, override `name`




 Basic tags for this layer 
---------------------------



Elements must have the all of following tags to be shown on this layer:








 Supported attributes 
----------------------





 gps_location 
==============



<img src='https://mapcomplete.org/crosshair:var(--catch-detail-color)' height="100px"> 

Meta layer showing the current location of the user. Add this to your theme and override the icon to change the appearance of the current location. The object will always have `id=gps` and will have _all_ the properties included in the [`Coordinates`-object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GeolocationCoordinates) (except latitude and longitude) returned by the browser, such as `speed`, `altitude`, `heading`, ....






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **0** and higher
  - **This layer is included automatically in every theme. This layer might contain no points**
  - Elements don't have a title set and cannot be toggled nor will they show up in the dashboard. If you import this layer in your theme, override `title` to make this toggleable.

 Supported attributes 
----------------------





 gps_location_history 
======================



<img src='https://mapcomplete.org/square:red' height="100px"> 

Meta layer which contains the previous locations of the user as single points. This is mainly for technical reasons, e.g. to keep match the distance to the modified object






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **1** and higher
  - **This layer is included automatically in every theme. This layer might contain no points**
  - This layer is not visible by default and must be enabled in the filter by the user. 
  - Elements don't have a title set and cannot be toggled nor will they show up in the dashboard. If you import this layer in your theme, override `title` to make this toggleable.
  - This layer is not visible by default and the visibility cannot be toggled, effectively resulting in a fully hidden layer. This can be useful, e.g. to calculate some metatags. If you want to render this layer (e.g. for debugging), enable it by setting the URL-parameter layer-<id>=true
  - Not visible in the layer selection by default. If you want to make this layer toggable, override `name`

 home_location 
===============



<img src='https://mapcomplete.org/circle:white;./assets/svg/home.svg' height="100px"> 

Meta layer showing the home location of the user. The home location can be set in the [profile settings](https://www.openstreetmap.org/profile/edit) of OpenStreetMap.






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **0** and higher
  - **This layer is included automatically in every theme. This layer might contain no points**
  - Elements don't have a title set and cannot be toggled nor will they show up in the dashboard. If you import this layer in your theme, override `title` to make this toggleable.

 gps_track 
===========





Meta layer showing the previous locations of the user as single line with controls, e.g. to erase, upload or download this track. Add this to your theme and override the maprendering to change the appearance of the travelled track.






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **0** and higher
  - **This layer is included automatically in every theme. This layer might contain no points**
  - This layer is not visible by default and must be enabled in the filter by the user. 
  - Not rendered on the map by default. If you want to rendering this on the map, override `mapRenderings`
