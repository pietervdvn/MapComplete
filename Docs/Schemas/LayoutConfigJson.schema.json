Either put in the name of the layer to reuse, or use {builtin: \"layername\", override: ...}\n\nThe 'override'-object will be copied over the original values of the layer, which allows to change certain aspects of the layer\n\nFor example: If you would like to use layer nature reserves, but only from a specific operator (eg. Natuurpunt) you would use the following in your theme:\n\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": \"nature_reserve\",\n \"override\": {\"source\": \n {\"osmTags\": {\n \"+and\":[\"operator=Natuurpunt\"]\n   }\n  }\n }\n}\n```\n\nIt's also possible to load multiple layers at once, for example, if you would like for both drinking water and benches to start at the zoomlevel at 12, you would use the following:\n\n```\n\"layer\": {\n \"builtin\": [\"benches\", \"drinking_water\"],\n \"override\": {\"minzoom\": 12}\n}\n```",

Currently, this is the same as 'false' but this will change in the future\n- or: a hash with options (see below)\n\n The delete dialog\n =================\n\n\n\n#### Hard deletion if enough experience\n\nA feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:\n\n- It is a node\n- No ways or relations use the node\n- The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously\n- The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)\n- The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)\n\nIn all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.\n\n#### Soft deletion\n\nA 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted from OSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.\nThis makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.\n\nNote that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme\n\n#### No-delete options\n\nIn some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed \"because the path is on their private property\").\nHowever, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice \"hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)\n\nThe correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.\nA no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags.",
